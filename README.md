## Known Issues

- **iOS 10 CoreAudio Crash** - On devices running iOS 10 (at least as of Beta 7), host applications will crash if the device is locked while an NYT360ViewController is visible (whether paused or not). The crash is caused by a CoreAudio exception. [An extended discussion of the issue can be found here](https://github.com/nytm/ios-360-videos/issues/37). A workaround that appears to work for some, though not all, apps is to enable the background audio capability in the host application's plist.
